        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Leo and I am currently a third year student at UCSC.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a CS major and I am interested in app development, full stack development, and game development.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my free time I like to play video games and explore new areas that might interest me. Currently I love watching videos about interior design and new technology.
        </p>

        <p>Skills: Python, Java, C, C++, MIPS Assembly, TypeScript, JavaScript, Three.js, React.js, CSS</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          <h4>HTTP Server</h4>
          A multithreaed HTTP Server that can handle cURL requests including GET, PUT, and APPEND. 
          It also allows full customization on how many threads to open and which port to use.
          The program is written completely in C using the pthread library and can be found on my 
          <a href="https://github.com/THL-Leo/httpserver">Github page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>cURL replica</h4>
          A Python program designed to replicate the basic cURL functions. Similar to the HTTP Server above, this parses the 
          request and return the status code and the content of the page. However, this is simplified and a specific port is designed to not work.
          The program also creates a csv file to log the entries of each cURL requests. You can also track these requests via WireShark and see each individual requests and responses.

        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Traveling Salesman Problem</h4>
          The Traveling Salesman problem is a well known problem that has not been solved yet. This program is an attempt to 
          solve the problem. It can handle up to 26 vertices and will find the shortest path between 2 vertices using Depth First Search.
          It also supports piping the output to a file. If not specified, then it will output to stdout.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>Lab Grader</h3>
        <h4>Jack Baskin School of Engineering, UCSC (December 2021 - June 2022)</h4>
        <p>
          Specializes in writing testing scripts for each lab. Languaged used includes Python, C, and Bash to speed up the grading process.
          Output the results to a file named after the student's ID to keep files organized.
        </p>
        <h3>Tutor</h3>
        <h4>Jack Baskin School of Engineering, UCSC (March 2021 - March 2022)</h4>
        <p>
          Helped tutor for the following classes: CSE 20, CSE 12, and CSE 13S. Taught various data structures in languages such as Python, MIPS Assembly and C.
          Organized lecture materials and simplified them so students can understand better.
        </p>
        <h3>Java Tutor</h3>
        <h4>RootTech, Irvine (July 2020 - August 2020)</h4>
        <p>
          As a reponse to Covid-19, I offered free AP Computer Science A courses to over 200 High School students over 2 months.
          The goal of the courses is to preview/review these materials since remote learning is much less effective compared to in-person.
